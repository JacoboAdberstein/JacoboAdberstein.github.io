### What is AWI?

The Astronaut Wrist Interface (AWI) has been a project that I have been working on as my senior design project. What started as a simple school assignment quickly turned into a project that I fell in love with. The first and most important reason why this project has been a delight is because of its balance between complexity and feasibility. The development of the AWI is by no means an easy task, but because of the scale of the project I have had the privilege of developing a prototype of the flight unit device. For a while I debated to myself about making this post or series of posts about the project, but it has been such a cool project that I felt compelled to share it. Before going any further on my journey with AWI, what even is AWI?

The Astronaut Wrist Interface (AWI) in its most stripped down version would be an interactive device located on the wrist/cuff of an astronaut's extra-vehicular activity suit (EVA suit) that provides him or her with an interface that displays mission checklists, suit telemetry data, and a navigation system. The long term vision for the AWI system is an interactive platform that could allow astronauts to also control robots or other space machines, connect and interact with a heads-up display, and more. The system would help astronauts perform missions outside spacecraft, or planetary bases. 


### Why hasn't something like the AWI been developed already?

The truth is that a system like the AWI has already been developed and tested by NASA in the 90s. NASA developed an electronic checklist that also went on the cuff of the EVA suit (figure 1). This electronic checklist was tested on several missions in the Shuttle era. Some of the most critical feedback from the mission tests included battery or display failures due to extreme temperatures of space, while some of the less critical but still noteworthy feedback notes related to the glare of the screen, or the bulkiness of the overall device (Marmolejo). The image below shows the electronic cuff developed by NASA. Some of the important features of the NASA's electronic cuff were an LCD screen, LCD heater, and a Lithium-Bromide battery pack. 

The NASA electronic cuff's development was stagnated in a sense due to the technology available at the time. Thankfully, nowadays, the smartphone industry as well as the battery industry are leaps ahead in technology to what was available during that time. New types of display technologies like flexible OLED screens allow for better resolution in a less bulky package. New Lithium-ion batteries are allowing high power consumption devices to be on for extended periods of time, while taking up less space.

While the technology in almost every component of the electronic cuff has been improved, the harsh environment of space still poses a very tough challenge. The current battery and display technology is still not advanced enough to withstand the extreme temperatures of space. Any system developed right now would still need to deal with heaters and proper thermal balances for the components. By far, the greatest improvement in today's technology compared to the technology of the time, is the reliability of the display and battery systems.

I believe that with the current technology a system like the AWI would be difficult to develop, but feasible. At the end of the day, it being difficult to develop is what makes it fun.
