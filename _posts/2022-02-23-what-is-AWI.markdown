The Astronaut Wrist Interface (AWI) has been a project that I have been working on as my senior design project. What started as a simple school assignment quickly turned into a project that I fell in love with. The first and most important reason why this project has been a delight is because of its balance between complexity and feasibility. The development of the AWI is by no means an easy task, but because of the scale of the project I have had the privilege of developing a prototype of the flight unit device. For a while I debated to myself about making this post or series of posts about the project, but it has been such a cool project that I felt compelled to share it. Before going any further on my journey with AWI, what even is AWI?
